## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pranavisback/portfolio-website.git
    cd portfolio-website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Due to potential peer dependency conflicts, it's recommended to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser to view the website.

### Build for Production

To create a production-ready build of the website:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile the project into the `dist` directory, which can then be deployed to any static hosting service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Changing Content

*   **Text Content:** Most of the text content (e.g., hero section text, about me description, skill names) can be found and edited directly in `src/App.jsx`.
*   **Project Details:** Project information (title, description, image, tech stack, links) is managed within the `projects` array in `src/App.jsx` and `src/components/ProjectDetail.jsx`.

### Updating Images

*   **Profile Image:** Replace `src/assets/my_image.png` with your own profile picture. Ensure it's a circular image for best results with the existing styling.
*   **Project Thumbnails:** Replace the images in `src/assets/` (e.g., `project_thumbnail_1.png`) with your project-specific images.

### Adding New Projects

1.  **Add Project Data:** In `src/App.jsx` and `src/components/ProjectDetail.jsx`, add a new object to the `projects` (or `projectsData`) array following the existing structure. Ensure you provide a unique `id` for the new project.
2.  **Add Project Image:** Place your project's thumbnail image in the `src/assets/` directory and import it into `App.jsx` and `ProjectDetail.jsx`.

### Adjusting Styles

*   **Global Styles:** `src/App.css` contains global styles, custom utility classes, and animations.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For component-specific styling, utilize Tailwind CSS classes directly in your JSX files. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for available classes.
